  <h2>About</h2>
<p>  from Austin Texas. In the fall I will be a junior (grade 11), and I can't wait to apply to colleges. Right now I live at home with my mom and dad. I have one sibling, his name is Nic and he is 22 years old. He is off at ATM university. My dream school is actually ATM. I have 11 animals. 2 dogs, Perl and Bit. 3 cats Cali, Purrbot, and Trace. Then I have 3 fish, Velvet, Azul, and Mr. Bubbles. And last but not least I have 2 snails, Jae, and itzy, then I have a shrimp named Spike. This past year I adopted a horse named Dawn. She is my baby girl. When I'm not at girls who code, you will catch me riding my horse, writing songs, playing my ukulele, or at the gym with my friends. I am Pansexual. I am proud of myself. I do not fall into societies traps. I act how I want to. I am my own person with my own views on politics and the way the world is run. Im hoping to use this website to help change the world. A wise man once said, "I would like to believe as many true things, and disbelieve as many false things as possible." That mans name is Matt Dillahunty. He is a famous atheist speaker from Austin Texas. He is the reason I am able to be confident when I say there is good in this world, people who know the difference between right and wrong. I have constant reminders that I am surrounded by good people. If you agree, then you should come to the Free Thought Library, in Austin Texas. All are welcome. We are all surrounded by good and evil. But there is more good than evil. In this world. We just need to find the good and encourage it to blossom. That is my mission. Help me get the wold to way the way it should be. Filled with free education, fair laws, and just pure good. We need to stand together. Never be afraid to be who you are. You are amazing no matter what you think. I am here to help end this hatred of our society. I am here to help. Help me help you.
